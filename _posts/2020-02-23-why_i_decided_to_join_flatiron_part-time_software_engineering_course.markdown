Prior to starting my studies at Flatiron's part-time Software Engineering class, I conducted a brief survey aimed at learning about the the growth of Software Engineering as well as Aritifial Integlligence in the U.S. and global job markets to determine if moving ahead in this field was a better decision. The results were staggering: software engineering is projected to grow by 21% from 2018 to 2028 and AI is expected  to incrementally add 16 percent or around $13 trillion by 2030 to current global economic output-- an annual average contribution to productivity growth of about 1.2 percent between now and 2030. As a result, I became greatly motived to start my studies toward becoming a software engineer as a first step that would ultimately pave the way for me to enter AI industry, which will be my major goal to achieve in the future. 

In addition to positive job market prospects noted above, I was interested in developing my personal innovative and creative skills set that would equip me to build useful tools such as Apps or other web-based programs to solve real-life problems. For instance, I have been interested in developing an App that will help people, particularly youth, who spend extremely long time addictedly in various Social Media platforms, with serious adverse impact on their mental health, to break away from them and focus on their lives. I envisioned that the Map would help them put their lives back on track by assisting them set their priorities and manage their time accordingly effeciently.


Moreover, the skills that you learn in software engineering help one to improve their problem-sloving abilities which can be applied to day-to-day life and better its quality. To be successful at this program, I will focus on remaining consistent  in practicing as much as possible what I learn. I wil also focus on developing my skill to search online for solutions to potential technical issues pertaing to constrcut of coding. 

At last, I will spare no effort in reaching my goal described above. I will utilize some of the useful resources that Flatiron provides to its students including a very rich community of software engineering professionals through Slack in achieving my goal.
